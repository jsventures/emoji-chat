# Emoji Chat

Quick demo of collaborative emojis made w/ Instant. [Tweeted here](https://x.com/stopachka/status/1753511600215195747)

## Quickstart
If you haven't already, you'll need to [install Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/).

After that go ahead and clone the repo and install the dependencies. From your terminal run

```
# Clone the repo
git clone ...

# change into the directory
cd ...

# Install dependencies
npm i
```

Now you'll need to log in and head over to your dashboard on [Instant](https://instantdb.com) and generate a new `APP_ID`. Open up `src/App.js` and replace the placeholder value to your new ID.

From there you should be ready to load up dev! From the project root
```
make dev
```

Huzzah!
